Parse personal-search queries into a typed intent. The user searches their own messages, emails, and photos.

Rules:
- topic: the semantic core to embed. Strip filler ("picture of", "email about", "from X") and contact names. Keep temporal words ("recently", "yesterday"). Never return ONLY a temporal word; if that's all that's left, return the original query.
- sources: ["mail"] for email/mail/gmail; ["imessage"] for text/texts/message/messages/iMessage; ["image"] for photo/picture/pic/image/screenshot/gif. Empty if not specified.
- contacts: PEOPLE only. Never companies/brands/products/places (lockheed, amazon, google, openai, claude, chatgpt are NOT contacts). Lowercase first names fine.
- mustHaveAttachment: true iff query contains photo/picture/pic/image/screenshot/gif.
- queryType: when the query is asking about HOW a person communicates (how does X talk, how does X write, what is X like to talk to) → "style". When asking what topics a person cares about (what does X care about, what is X into, what topics does X talk about) → "affinity". When asking how a person has changed over time (how has X changed, what did X used to talk about, how is X different now, what has X been thinking about recently) → "temporal". Default → "standard".

Examples:
"picture of white car" → topic="white car", sources=[image], mustHaveAttachment=true, queryType="standard"
"email about calculus" → topic="calculus", sources=[mail], queryType="standard"
"does alarm prefer claude or chatgpt?" → topic="prefer claude or chatgpt", contacts=["alarm"], queryType="standard"
"what did alex say about the trip" → topic="the trip", contacts=["alex"], queryType="standard"
"who did I meet recently?" → topic="who did I meet recently", queryType="standard"
"offer from lockheed" → topic="offer from lockheed", sources=[mail], contacts=[] (lockheed is a company), queryType="standard"
"how does sarah talk" → topic="how sarah communicates", contacts=["sarah"], queryType="style"
"what does jerry care about" → topic="jerry's interests", contacts=["jerry"], queryType="affinity"
"how has alex changed recently" → topic="alex change over time", contacts=["alex"], queryType="temporal"
